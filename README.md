Our project was mainly addressing the load issue of customer services of Vodafone.
We decided that we can digitalize most of the operations and information provided by conventional customer services.
For that we decided to create a online customer service in which customer can communicate with A.İ bot trained in solving customer problems.
Users can start chatting and addressing their problem with A.İ bot just as if it's real human - company representative.
We trained A.İ to recognize common problems faced by people and solve them if it's possible or guide users to solution.
For example let's say that a client needs technician to come over and install new wifi router for that consumer needs to book a date for technician by going to physical branch 
to meet with representative or call the call center and talk with them. With our A.İ powered bot, bot can access Vodafone database and set up a booking automatically 
without any human assistance. 
Of course we don't have access to Vodafone database ,so we used sample data to show that  bot can recognize what needs to be done just by simple conversation
with consumer and can perform operations. 
Other consumer service uses that our bot recognizes and could be done automatically without human assistance by connecting it to Vodafone database: 

acquiring information about services, contracts, payment or renewing contracts, helping consumer to troubleshoot technical problems etc.
To build this bot we used Google API named "Dialogflow" on backend side and on frontend we used Android Studio with Java programming language.
We trained our bot by "feeding" it with most commonly used consumer service matters.
